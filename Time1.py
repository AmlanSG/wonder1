# Searching an element in a list/array in python
# can be simply done using \'in\' operator
# Example:
# if x in arr:
# print arr.index(x)

# If you want to implement Linear Search in python

# Linearly search x in arr[]
# If x is present then return its location
# else return -1

def search(arr, x):

	for i in range(len(arr)):

		if arr[i] == x:
			return i

	return -1

arr = [2,3,5,7,9,1,5]

x = 99

print (search (arr,x))
